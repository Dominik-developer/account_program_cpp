# account_program_cpp

This is my old school project; I built it about one and a half years ago it allows you to log in, register, draw, and sort numbers.

It's 100% written in C++. Unfortunately, it's with all writings in Polish.

I have built it, and the beginning of my programming journey, so it may not be perfect. I may build an upgraded version in English in the future.
